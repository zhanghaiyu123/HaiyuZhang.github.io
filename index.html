	<h2>Haiyu Zhang's homepage</h2>

	I am a second-year master student in mathematics at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in ShenZhen, China. My advisor is <a href="https://yifeizhu.github.io/" target="_blank">Yifei Zhu</a>. I received my B.S. from SUSTech in 2024.<br> <br> 
	
	My research interests lie in the mathematical foundations of machine learning, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior and interpretability of neural networks. I am also interested in designing and improving theoretically grounded machine learning algorithms and models. My previous work primarily focused on deep learning theory and the intersection of machine learning with geometry and topology.<br> <br>

					<br> <br>
				</summary>
				The concept of "intrinsic dimension" (ID) is motivated by Leo Breiman's first question: Why don't heavily parameterized neural networks overfit? Existing studies suggest that the fractal dimension of weight trajectories, which is regarded as ID, can serve as an intrinsic measure of "effective" hypothesis complexity to shed light on the generalization mystery. A rigorous framework for generalization bounds, established through PAC-Bayesian theory, has demonstrated a positive correlation between ID and the generalization gap.
This talk reviews these existing results, elaborates on the limitations of current research, and proposes a research plan based on these findings.

						<br> <br>
				</summary>
			 This talk summarizes the foundational work by Carlsson et al. on Topological Data Analysis and Topological Deep Learning in image processing, and presents some results of reproduction and improvement of relevant models.

It begins by reviewing the groundbreaking TDA study on natural image patches in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-007-0056-x" target="_blank">Carlsson et al. 2008</a>, which extracted a submanifold with the topology of the Klein bottle. The talk then presents results reproducing the work of  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03234" target="_blank">Gabrielsson and Carlsson, 2019</a> on the topology of neural networks using Persistent Homology. These findings show that CNN kernels progressively learn topological structures (circles, Klein bottles) that align with the intrinsic topology of high-contrast image patches. This suggests learned kernels function as discrete differential operators, extracting local features like edges.

Building on this insight, and inspired by <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/21-0073.html" target="_blank">Love et al, 2023</a>, an optimized topological CNN model for image classification is proposed. This model improves performance by embedding the topological structure into the neural network and sampling convolution kernels from non-uniform probability distributions defined on these manifolds.

					<br> <br>
				</summary>
				Ando established an algebraic criterion for when a complex orientation for a Morava E-theory is an H<sub>&#x221E;</sub>-map. The criterion relates such an orientation to a specific property of the formal group associated to the E-theory, namely, a norm coherence condition on its coordinate. On the other hand, Coleman constructed a norm operator for interpolating division values in local fields, which depends on a Lubin--Tate formal group law. These formal group laws are important tools in explicit local class field theory. 
				<br> <br>
	       			In this article, we give a conceptual proof for Ando's theorem using the Coleman norm operator via the bridge of formal group laws between topology and arithmetic.  
				<br> <br>
				This article grows out from my Bachelor thesis below. Comparing to the thesis, it focuses more on the topological side and is in terms of formal groups. Moreover, my undergraduate thesis requires the Morava E-theory to classify deformations of a Honda formal group law, but this article only requires it to classify deformations of a formal group law of finite height.

					<a href="Writings/Redshift.pdf" target="_blank">Redshift conjecture for commutative ring spectra </a> 
					<br> <br> 
				</summary>
				Redshift conjecture concerns about how algebraic K-theory interacts with chromatic homotopy theory. It says that the algebraic K-theory raises the chromatic complexity by 1. The conjecture for commutative ring spectra has been formulated and solved by a series of works by Burklund, Clausen, Hahn, Land, Matthew, Meier, Naumann, Noel, Schlank, Tamme and Yuan. In this note, we introduce and summarize the proof of the redshift conjecture for commutative ring spectra.

					<a href="Writings/Ambidexterity.pdf" target="_blank">Ambidexterity in chromatic homotopy theory </a> 
					<br> <br> 
				</summary>
				This is a survey written with Xiansheng Li of paper with the same title by Carmeli, Schlank and Yanovski. In this survey, we state and prove the main result of the paper that the cateogory of T(n)-local spectra is &#x221E;-semiadditive. The original paper sets up a general machinery to solve the ambidexterity problems. However, we want to depict the core of the proof and prove the main theorem more directly. Hence, the content of this survey is almost a subset of the original paper, extracting essential details without any diagram chasing and keeping specific to be intuitive.

			This is my note for the talk on the course Topics in Algebraic Topology at University of Copenhagen, taught by <a href="https://web.math.ku.dk/~larsh/" target="_blank">Lars Hesselholt </a>. This talk contains two parts. The first one is a modular interpretation of power operations in Morava E-theory via deformations of Frobenius, for which the main reference is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2499" target="_blank">The congruence criterion for power operations in Morava E-theory </a>. The second one is an application of power operations in Morava E-theory in the computation of homotopy groups, for which the main reference is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00960" target="_blank">On the rationalization of the K(n)-local sphere </a>. We will also give a short introduction to this paper.

					<br> <br> 
				</summary>
				Local class field theory was originally proved via global class field theory, and there was no explicit description of the local Artin map and the maximal abelian extension K<sup>ab</sup> of a local field K. In 1965, Lubin and Tate constructed an explicit form of the local Artin map and K<sup>ab</sup> from formal group laws. In 1979, Coleman proved an interpolation theorem on division values in local fields by constructing a norm operator depending on Lubin-Tate formal group laws. On the other hand, in topology, Ando established an algebraic criterion on when a complex orientation MU &#x279D; E<sub>n</sub> for Morava E-theory is an H<sub>&#x221E;</sub>-map. The criterion relates desired orientations to a specific property of formal group laws. 
				<br> <br>
	        		This is my undergraduate thesis and this thesis has two parts. Firstly, we prove explicit local class field theory following of Lubin and Tate. Secondly, we give a new proof of Ando's theorem in topology via Coleman's norm operator from explicit local class field theory.

				</summary>
				This is a survey of chromatic homotopy theory. In this survey, we first show the global picture of chromatic homotopy theory. Then we will introduce the theory following <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/nilp.html" target="_blank">Ravenel's orange book </a>. We will first introduce the periodicity theorem and telescope conjecture, which is a geometric model of the algebraic chromatic filtration, a filtration of homotopy groups that is easier to compute. Then we talk about the thick category theorem, which gives a filtration of the category of finite p-local complexes.

				This is the final paper for the Algebraic Topology course taken in UCB taught by <a href="https://math..edu/~teleman/" target="_blank">Constantin Teleman </a>. The survey gives an introduction to algebraic K-theory. We first introduce the classical definition of K<sub>0</sub>, K<sub>1</sub> groups and some properties of them. Then we apply Quillen’s plus construction to construct general K<sub>n</sub> and show that they are in accord with the previous definitions when n = 0, 1. Finally, we give a brief introduction to the K-theory &#x2126; spectrum.

					<br> <br> 
				</summary>
				This is a report for the  Mathematics Directed Reading Program in UCB. We talk about elliptic curves over complex numbers in this survey. First we introduce elliptic curves from the calculation of the arc lengths of ellipses, which is the historical origin of elliptic curves. Then we present some general basics of elliptic curves, like the group law and isogenies. Finally, we prove the equivalence of categories of elliptic curves over complex numbers and lattices in the complex plane.
